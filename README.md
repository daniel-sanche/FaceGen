## About the Project

This project is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network, trained to generate faces using the IMDB-WIKI dataset. This project was created for my term project for the University of Saskatchewan's CMPT 498: Learning and Data Analytics course in Fall 2016.

## Python Scripts

- NeuralNet.py
  - cointains all tensorflow code building the model, along training, logging, sampling, and other related functions
- Trainer.py
  - loads an instance of the network, and runs training samples through it, printing results
- DataLoader.py
  - filters the IMDB-WIKI dataset to a smaller number of high quality images, and builds an index for quick access
  - contains a function that will load batches of images in a background thread, for use in training the neural network
- Sampler.pt
  - used to generate images from the trained network
- CsvStats.py
  - outputs information about the dataset csv file generated by DataLoader.py
- FaceDetector.py
  - uses OpenCV's Haar face detector to determine whether a face is in an image
  - used to evaluate results, by running the face deterctor on generated images
  - this file is run to train the network
- Visualization.py
  - used to generate a png containing a grid of faces
  - faces are input as a numpy array

## Usage

#### Training
To train the network, modify the "datasetDir" variable in Training.py, and run the script for as may training rounds as desired.

Before training, the IMDB-WIKI dataset will be filtered and indexed, with no input required by the user
#### Sampling
To obtain generated face images from a trained network, run Sampler.py. A number of sample images will be generated in the working directory

## Results

Included in this repository is a file called "Project Paper.pdf". This paper details the results of the project, and provides sample images generated by the network
